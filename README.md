See the overall picture to see the architecture for the Botpress project.

## Components.

#### Client service. 
* A React Scripts Application that provides the code to execute on the browser. 
* Docker is used as container presenting a development image with hot reload. 
* Typescript is used as programming language.
* MUI is used as Material Design CSS Framework.

#### Watcher service.
* Node.js application.
* Websocket server that provides realtime communication with the client, using socket.io library. 
* Docker is used as container presenting a development image with hot reload also. 
* Initial requirements asked to use folders to watch by arguments, but I changed to read from watcher.txt file to gain more flexibility at the moment to use the docker images. 
* Unit tests are included to show the use of Jest. I only included a few test cases, mocking some objects, etc. It doesn't include all the possbiles scenarios to test. My target here was show the integration and configuration the test on the project. 
* A testfolder folder was included, as directory to watch. It is configured in the watcher.txt file. You can manage files/folders inside this directory, or include other paths in watcher.txt before run the project. 
* Typescript is used as programming language.

#### Nginx service.
* I used Nginx server for expose the service to the clients and for routing the communication with client and watcher services.

#### Docker Compose establishment with all services on docker.
* Containerization of microservices.
